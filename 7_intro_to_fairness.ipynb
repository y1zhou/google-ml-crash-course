    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll work with the [Adult Census Income dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income), which is commonly used in machine learning literature. This data was extracted from the [1994 Census bureau database](http://www.census.gov/en.html) by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each example in the dataset contains the following demographic data for a set of individuals who took part in the 1994 Census:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric Features\n",
    "*   `age`: The age of the individual in years.\n",
    "*   `fnlwgt`: The number of individuals the Census Organizations believes that set of observations represents.\n",
    "*   `education_num`:  An enumeration of the categorical representation of education. The higher the number, the higher the education that individual achieved. For example, an `education_num` of `11` represents `Assoc_voc` (associate degree at a vocational school), an `education_num` of `13` represents `Bachelors`, and an `education_num` of `9` represents `HS-grad` (high school graduate).\n",
    "*   `capital_gain`: Capital gain made by the individual, represented in US Dollars.\n",
    "*   `capital_loss`: Capital loss mabe by the individual, represented in US Dollars.\n",
    "*   `hours_per_week`: Hours worked per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categorical Features\n",
    "*   `workclass`: The individual's type of employer. Examples include: `Private`, `Self-emp-not-inc`, `Self-emp-inc`, `Federal-gov`, `Local-gov`, `State-gov`, `Without-pay`, and `Never-worked`.\n",
    "*   `education`: The highest level of education achieved for that individual.\n",
    "*   `marital_status`: Marital status of the individual. Examples include: `Married-civ-spouse`, `Divorced`, `Never-married`, `Separated`, `Widowed`, `Married-spouse-absent`, and `Married-AF-spouse`.\n",
    "*   `occupation`: The occupation of the individual. Example include: `tech-support`, `Craft-repair`, `Other-service`, `Sales`, `Exec-managerial` and more.\n",
    "*   `relationship`:  The relationship of each individual in a household. Examples include: `Wife`, `Own-child`, `Husband`, `Not-in-family`, `Other-relative`, and `Unmarried`.\n",
    "*   `gender`:  Gender of the individual available only in binary choices: `Female` or `Male`.\n",
    "*   `race`: `White`, `Asian-Pac-Islander`, `Amer-Indian-Eskimo`, `Black`, and `Other`. \n",
    "*   `native_country`: Country of origin of the individual. Examples include: `United-States`, `Cambodia`, `England`, `Puerto-Rico`, `Canada`, `Germany`, `Outlying-US(Guam-USVI-etc)`, `India`, `Japan`, and more.\n",

    "The prediction task is to **determine whether a person makes over $50,000 US Dollar a year.**\n",

    "\n",
    "All the examples extracted for this dataset meet the following conditions: \n",
    "*   `age` is 16 years or older.\n",
    "*   The adjusted gross income (used to calculate `income_bracket`) is greater than $100 USD annually.\n",

    "\n",
    "While evaluating the overall performance of the model gives us some insight into its quality, it doesn't give us much insight into how well our model performs for different subgroups.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating a model for fairness, it's important to determine whether prediction errors are uniform across subgroups or whether certain subgroups are more susceptible to certain prediction errors than others. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key tool for comparing the prevalence of different types of model errors is a *confusion matrix*. Recall from the [Classification module of Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/true-false-positive-negative) that a confusion matrix is a grid that plots predictions vs. ground truth for your model, and tabulates statistics summarizing how often your model made the correct prediction and how often it made the wrong prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by creating a binary confusion matrix for our income-prediction model—binary because our label (`income_bracket`) has only two possible values (`<50K` or `>50K`). We'll define an income of `>50K` as our **positive label**, and an income of `<50k` as our **negative label**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** *Positive* and *negative* in this context should not be interpreted as value judgments (we are not suggesting that someone who earns more than 50k a year is a better person than someone who earns less than 50k). They are just standard terms used to distinguish between the two possible predictions the model can make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cases where the model makes the correct prediction (the prediction matches the ground truth) are classified as **true**, and cases where the model makes the wrong prediction are classified as **false**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our confusion matrix thus represents four possible states:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **true positive**: Model predicts `>50K`, and that is the ground truth.\n",
    "* **true negative**: Model predicts `<50K`, and that is the ground truth.\n",
    "* **false positive**: Model predicts `>50K`, and that contradicts reality.\n",
    "* **false negative**: Model predicts `<50K`, and that contradicts reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** If desired, we can use the number of outcomes in each of these states to calculate secondary evaluation metrics, such as [precision and recall](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/precision-and-recall)."

    "Using default parameters, you may find that the model performs better for female than male. Specifically, in our run, we found that both accuracy and AUC for female (0.9137 and 0.9089, respectively) outperformed male (0.7923 and 0.8549, respectively). What is going on here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the number of true positives (top-left corner) for female is way lower compared to male (479 to 3822). Recall that in Task #1 we noticed a disproportionately high representation of male in the data set (almost 2-to-1). If you further explore the data set using Facets Dive in Task #2 by setting the color to `income_bracket` and one of the axes to `gender`, then you will also find a disproportionately small number of female examples in the higher income bracket, our positive label. \n",
    "\n",
    "What this is all suggesting is that the model is **overfitting, particuarly with respect to female and lower income bracket**. In other words, this model will not generalize well, particularly with female data, as it does not have enough positive examples for the model to learn from. It is **not doing that much better with male, either, as there is a disproportionately small number of high income bracket compared to low income bracket** — though not nearly as poorly represented as with female.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully going through this confusion matrix demonstration you find that the results varies slightly from the overall performance metrics, highlighting the importance of evaluating model performance across subgroup rather than in aggregate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your work, make sure that you make a good decision about the tradeoffs between false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives. For example, you may want a very low false positive rate, but a high true positive rate. Or you may want a high precision, but a low recall is okay.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Choose your evaluation metrics in light of these desired tradeoffs.**"
